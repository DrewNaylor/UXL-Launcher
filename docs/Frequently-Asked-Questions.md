## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What is UXL Launcher?

A: UXL Launcher (Unified eXecutable Launcher) is the successor to "Drew's App Launcher," and the first stable release will be version 3.0 to show the relationship between Drew's App Launcher (last official release is 2.8.x) and UXL Launcher (first official release will be 3.0.)

UXL Launcher allows the user to launch Microsoft Office apps from one place instead of just using a folder with shortcuts to the apps.

Q: That sounds like something I could use! How much does it cost?

A: UXL Launcher is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) both in freedom and price and is licensed under the Gnu GPL v3+ license. This means you're allowed to download the software and use it at no charge at all. If you want to, you can also play around with the source code however you like and if you improve a feature, you're allowed to contribute back to the project.

Q: So, what language is UXL Launcher written in?

A: I used VB.Net to develop the program.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: VB.Net? I heard that it's not as good as C# for software development! Why did you use VB.Net?

A: VB.Net isn't actually very different from C# and they're both compiled to the same language (.Net IL) in the end anyway so for Windows desktop app development it doesn't really matter. On the other hand, C# is better for game development with engines such as Unity.

<br>
<br>
Q: Alright. I believe you. But why did you use .Net in the first place? It makes bloated apps!

A: UXL Launcher is, as of December 5, 2016, less than 1 MB in size.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Less than 1 MB? That means UXL Launcher has very few features!

A: Nope. It's just that UXL Launcher focuses on launching Microsoft Office software and does so in a code-efficient manner.
<br>
<br>
<br>
