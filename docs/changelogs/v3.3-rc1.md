# UXL Launcher Version 3.3 Release Candidate 1 Changelog
Released on 7/7/2020 (MM/DD/YYYY).

About a year and a half after the previous version, UXL Launcher Version 3.3 is ready for the release candidate stage. If all goes well, two weeks from now the stable version will be released. Time's gone by so fast that it doesn't feel like it's been seven years since the predecessor to this project was started. This version primarily focuses on allowing the About and Options windows to be themed, but there are a few other new features and bug fixes, including a new option to bypass the configured location for most apps. Please be sure to read the Readme included with this version of UXL Launcher or [online](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/uxl-launcher/blob/master/docs/readmes/readme-v3.3-rc1.txt) as it has important info. Also refer to the [System Requirements](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/UXL-Launcher/wiki/System-Requirements).

If you're reading this in Notepad or another text editor, it displays best in Word Wrap view. Click on Format>Word Wrap on the top bar. Notepad++ users will find it under View>Word Wrap. Word Wrap is automatically done if viewing on GitHub or on the website.

## Hashes

You can use Windows PowerShell to confirm the hash of the main UXL Launcher EXE file by running
`Get-FileHash .\UXL-Launcher.exe -Algorithm SHA256` in the folder you extracted the archive to and comparing the output to my sum listed below. HowToGeek has a nice [article on this](https://www.howtogeek.com/67241/htg-explains-what-are-md5-sha-1-hashes-and-how-do-i-check-them/), but the Windows section is a bit further down on the page.

To check the installer's hash, run `Get-FileHash .\UXL-Launcher_v3.2-Stable.exe -Algorithm SHA256` in Windows PowerShell.

SHA-256 sum for "UXL-Launcher.exe" in the archive:
41013DC21A36FF348AD9B2727059D2AFA10F3D7098042A154DE4D3E90A35F3C4

SHA-256 sum for "UXL-Launcher_v3.3-RC1.exe" (the installer attached to this release):

## Added

- The About and Options windows can now be themed in Theme Engine Version 1.03.
  - All built-in themes have support for this.
  - Themes need to set their UseThemeEngineVersion node value to 1.03 to apply colors to the About and Options windows. Themes that aren't upgraded to TE1.03 won't have their colors applied to forms other than the main window.
  - To accomplish this in custom themes, there are now additional controls that can be themed. Most examples taken from `TenDark`:
    - About window Banner Style: Options are "Light" and "Dark". Everything else will be set to "Light".  Default value: `Light`. Example:
	```xml
	<AboutWindow>
        <!-- This controls how the About window's banner appears.
        Available BannerStyle options are "Light" and "Dark".
        Anything else will be set to "Light". -->
        <BannerStyle>Dark</BannerStyle>
    </AboutWindow>
	```
	- Button FlatAppearance MouseOverBackColor: Can be any valid HTML or system color. Default value: `Nothing` (requires leaving the node out; `LiteralNothing` isn't supported for this property). Example:
	```xml
	<!-- Anything within the "FlatAppearance" element will only be used if
        "FlatStyle" is set to "Flat". -->
    <FlatAppearance>
	...
	<MouseOverBackColor>Gray</MouseOverBackColor>
	...
	</FlatAppearance>
	```
	- Button FlatAppearance MouseDownBackColor: Can be any valid HTML or system color. Default value: `Nothing` (requires leaving the node out; `LiteralNothing` isn't supported for this property). Example:
	```xml
	<!-- Anything within the "FlatAppearance" element will only be used if
        "FlatStyle" is set to "Flat". -->
    <FlatAppearance>
	...
	<MouseDownBackColor>Silver</MouseOverBackColor>
	...
	</FlatAppearance>
	```
	- Checkbox BackColor: Can be any valid HTML or system color. Default value: `Transparent`. Example:
	```xml

	```xml
	<Dropdown>
        <!-- This is for the ComboBox controls, but "Dropdown" is probably
        a more common name for people to call them. -->
        <BackColor>#363636</BackColor>
        ...
      </Dropdown>
	```
	- Dropdown (ComboBox) ForeColor: Can be any valid HTML or system color. Default value: `ControlText`. Example:

	```xml
	<LinkLabel>
        <BackColor>Transparent</BackColor>
        ...

	```
	- LinkLabel ForeColor: Can be any valid HTML or system color. Default value: `ControlText`. This is used when the `LinkArea` property is set to not cover the entire link label. Example:

	```xml
	<TableLayoutPanel>
        ...
        <!--If you want this to apply to the table layout panel inside the
        About window About tab, set ApplyToAboutWindowAboutTabTLP to True
        as shown below. Otherwise, the tab page control's colors will
        be used instead-->

- You can have UXL Launcher match the Windows 10 theme settings if you want to by checking the `Match Windows 10 theme settings` checkbox in the `Options` window `Personalization` tab.
  - Please be aware that the Windows 10 theme is only checked on startup, so it requires a restart to match the system theme.
  - The light theme is `Default`, and the dark theme is `TenDark`.
  - If the version of Windows that's being used doesn't support the `AppsUseLightTheme` key (if UXL Launcher is being run on Windows 7, for example), then the `Default` theme will be used instead.
- Themes that support TE1.03 can now specify `LiteralNothing` as the `StatusBar BackColor` value so that the small line at the top of the statusbar is visible as seen when not using the theme engine.
- Theme engine error handler now has an output for `System.ArgumentException` exceptions. These may appear if the textbox backcolor property doesn't support the specified color.
	
  
## Fixed

- Double-clicking on the column separators displays the package context menu. ([issue #16](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/issues/16))
- Fixed some typos in comments.

## Changed

- If the theme file specifies that it uses a newer version of the theme engine, a warning will be appended to the end of the theme details.
- Custom theme path is only displayed in the Immediate Window if the current theme is `(Custom)`.  

## Deprecated

- `update-manifests.bat` is deprecated as mentioned above. Its removal will be done in stages to slowly transition to a world that no longer relies on `update-manifests.bat` for any scenario:
  - For now it'll stay in the package, but be unused by default.  **<-- You Are Here**
  - Eventually the version in the package will be changed to be a simple script that tells you where to download the main script.
  - After a while it'll be fully removed from the package.
  - A while after that support for it will be fully removed from guinget. It's expected that support will be fully removed by the time guinget (and winget, but it may take longer for guinget to gain that feature) supports multiple sources, if not in the same version.
  - It may be possible that it'll go from being supported in a way that requires it to be enabled manually to being removed from the package, or having support be removed completely, all at once.
- Since the code to get details from winget is deprecated, it's been commented out as mentioned above. This code may continue to exist in this state as an example for how to get info from winget.
