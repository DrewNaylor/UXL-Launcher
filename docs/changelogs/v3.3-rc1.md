# UXL Launcher Version 3.3 Release Candidate 1 Changelog
Released on 7/7/2020 (MM/DD/YYYY).

About a year and a half after the previous version, UXL Launcher Version 3.3 is ready for the release candidate stage. If all goes well, two weeks from now the stable version will be released. Time's gone by so fast that it doesn't feel like it's been seven years since the predecessor to this project was started. This version primarily focuses on allowing the About and Options windows to be themed, but there are a few other new features and bug fixes, including a new option to bypass the configured location for most apps. Please be sure to read the Readme included with this version of UXL Launcher or [online](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/uxl-launcher/blob/master/docs/readmes/readme-v3.3-rc1.txt) as it has important info. Also refer to the [System Requirements](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/UXL-Launcher/wiki/System-Requirements).

If you're reading this in Notepad or another text editor, it displays best in Word Wrap view. Click on Format>Word Wrap on the top bar. Notepad++ users will find it under View>Word Wrap. Word Wrap is automatically done if viewing on GitHub or on the website.

## Hashes

You can use Windows PowerShell to confirm the hash of the main UXL Launcher EXE file by running
`Get-FileHash .\UXL-Launcher.exe -Algorithm SHA256` in the folder you extracted the archive to and comparing the output to my sum listed below. HowToGeek has a nice [article on this](https://www.howtogeek.com/67241/htg-explains-what-are-md5-sha-1-hashes-and-how-do-i-check-them/), but the Windows section is a bit further down on the page.

To check the installer's hash, run `Get-FileHash .\UXL-Launcher_v3.2-Stable.exe -Algorithm SHA256` in Windows PowerShell.

SHA-256 sum for "UXL-Launcher.exe" in the archive:
41013DC21A36FF348AD9B2727059D2AFA10F3D7098042A154DE4D3E90A35F3C4

SHA-256 sum for "UXL-Launcher_v3.3-RC1.exe" (the installer attached to this release):

## Added

- The About and Options windows can now be themed in Theme Engine Version 1.03.
  - All built-in themes have support for this.
  - Themes need to set their UseThemeEngineVersion node value to 1.03 to apply colors to the About and Options windows.
  - To accomplish this in custom themes, there are now additional controls that can be themed. Examples taken from `TenDark`:
  **`TODO: Add default values.`**
    - About window Banner Style: Options are "Light" and "Dark". Everything else will be set to "Light". Example:
	```xml
	<AboutWindow>
        <!-- This controls how the About window's banner appears.
        Available BannerStyle options are "Light" and "Dark".
        Anything else will be set to "Light". -->
        <BannerStyle>Dark</BannerStyle>
    </AboutWindow>
	```
	- Button FlatAppearance MouseOverBackColor: Can be any valid HTML or system color. If you wish to use the default of "Nothing", leave out the node. Example:
	```xml
	<!-- Anything within the "FlatAppearance" element will only be used if
        "FlatStyle" is set to "Flat". -->
    <FlatAppearance>
	...
	<MouseOverBackColor>Gray</MouseOverBackColor>
	...
	</FlatAppearance>
	```
	- Button FlatAppearance MouseDownBackColor: Can be any valid HTML or system color. If you wish to use the default of "Nothing", leave out the node. Example:
	```xml
	<!-- Anything within the "FlatAppearance" element will only be used if
        "FlatStyle" is set to "Flat". -->
    <FlatAppearance>
	...
	<MouseDownBackColor>Silver</MouseOverBackColor>
	...
	</FlatAppearance>
	```
	- Checkbox BackColor: Can be any valid HTML or system color. Example:

        ...
      </Dropdown>
	```
	- Dropdown (ComboBox) ForeColor: Can be any valid HTML or system color. Example:

	```xml
	<TableLayoutPanel>
        ...
        <!--If you want this to apply to the table layout panel inside the
        About window About tab, set ApplyToAboutWindowAboutTabTLP to True
        as shown below. Otherwise, the tab page control's colors will
        be used instead-->

## Fixed

- Double-clicking on the column separators displays the package context menu. ([issue #16](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/guinget/issues/16))

## Changed

- When focusing the Search box with `Ctrl+F`, the text in it is now selected so it's easier to type something else.
- The `Apply changes` window no longer displays in the taskbar, and it also no longer has a minimize button.
- Controls that could interfere with the update process are blocked from being used, though some are still available such as `File>Exit`, `Help>About`, and the package details textbox (if people get bored and want to read something while it updates). This really only impacts the built-in update system provided by `libguinget`.
- `update-manifests.bat`'s message box now talks about how it's deprecated and that it's being used instead of the built-in updater.
- About window text updates:
  - Separators to make it a bit easier to visualize where text starts and stops for the license parts
  - `libguinget` is now mentioned here: "Apache License 2.0 summary as it applies to guinget **and libguinget**:" (new text in bold)
- Code for getting package details from winget has been commented out to save space in `libguinget.dll`'s `PackageTools` class. This code is for example purposes and is deprecated.
- `libguinget`'s assembly info now has "Package **and package list** tools for guinget and other programs that want to use them." (new text in bold)
- Documentation updates:
  - Project roadmap had some things moved around a bit.
  - System requirements are now a bit more detailed, especially with regards to minimum and recommended hardware requirements based on my testing.
  - Usage instructions now talk about how to use the new, built-in package list updater.
  

## Deprecated

- `update-manifests.bat` is deprecated as mentioned above. Its removal will be done in stages to slowly transition to a world that no longer relies on `update-manifests.bat` for any scenario:
  - For now it'll stay in the package, but be unused by default.  **<-- You Are Here**
  - Eventually the version in the package will be changed to be a simple script that tells you where to download the main script.
  - After a while it'll be fully removed from the package.
  - A while after that support for it will be fully removed from guinget. It's expected that support will be fully removed by the time guinget (and winget, but it may take longer for guinget to gain that feature) supports multiple sources, if not in the same version.
  - It may be possible that it'll go from being supported in a way that requires it to be enabled manually to being removed from the package, or having support be removed completely, all at once.
- Since the code to get details from winget is deprecated, it's been commented out as mentioned above. This code may continue to exist in this state as an example for how to get info from winget.
