This table is a list of locations that Microsoft Office is known to install to, based on Drew Naylor's research installing each version listed. It's organized by Office version, whether the Windows install is 32-bit or 64-bit, whether Office itself is 32-bit or 64-bit, the installation method (Click-to-Run [C2R] or MSI), and the resulting location. Drive C is the drive letter that is assumed for all locations listed below. Microsoft Office and all related products are copyright and trademark Microsoft Corporation in the United States and/or other countries. Microsoft reserves all rights for Microsoft Office. See more details about the locations listed below [here](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/UXL-Launcher/issues/101) and [here](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/UXL-Launcher/issues/103).

Microsoft did make their own [list of install locations](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/command-line-switches-for-microsoft-office-products-079164cd-4ef5-4178-b235-441737deb3a6), but it's only for non-Office 365 installations. It's at that link under "Startup command names and locations".

If there are other locations not listed below, please [create an issue](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/UXL-Launcher/issues/new) with the Office version, Windows installation type (32-bit or 64-bit), whether Office is 32-bit or 64-bit, the installation method (whether Click-to-Run [C2R] or MSI was used), and the resulting location, along with a screenshot of the directory Office is stored in, but cover up any private information FIRST.
