This is a list of settings used in the UXL Launcher config file. Any settings that don't say how to change them must be changed in the config file (`UXL-Launcher.exe.config`)

| Setting name | Default value | Description |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| alwaysOnTop | False | If this is set to `True`, all application windows will be on top of other windows not set on top. Can be set by clicking `View>Always On Top`. [Version 3.0 has some issues with this](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/UXL-Launcher/issues/53). |
| officeDriveLocation | C | Used as part of the file path that's used to launch apps. This particular part is the drive letter at the beginning of the path. Can be modified from `Tools>Options...>General tab>Drive textbox`. |
| cpuIsSixtyFourBit | True | Used as part of the file path that's used to launch apps. This particular part decides whether to use the 64-bit or 32-bit `Program Files` folder. Can be changed from `Tools>Options...>Advanced tab>32-bit Windows radio button` or `64-bit Windows radio button`. |
| userHasOfficeThreeSixFive | False | Used as part of the file path that's used to launch apps. This particular part decides whether to launch from the `Microsoft Office\root\Office(version)` folder or to just use the `Microsoft Office\Office(version)`. Set this to `True` if you're not sure what MSI is (Office 2016 doesn't use MSI for the most part). Can be changed by (un)checking `Tools>Options...>General tab>I installed via Office 365 checkbox` (for Office 2010 and 2016 in version dropdown). [This checkbox will be combined with the `I installed via MSI checkbox` in version 3.2](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/UXL-Launcher/issues/100#issuecomment-395926431). |
| userOfficeVersion | 14 | Used as part of the file path that's used to launch apps. This particular part decides which Office version folder to launch from. Office 2010 is `14`, Office 2013 is `15`, and Office 2016 is `16`. Can be changed by changing the Office version from `Tools>Options...>General tab>Office version dropdown box`. |
| installedViaMSIPackage | False | Used as part of the file path that's used to launch apps. This particular part decides whether to launch from the `Microsoft Office\root\Office(version)` folder or to just use the `Microsoft Office\Office(version)`. Leave this `False` if you're not sure what MSI is (Office 2016 doesn't use MSI for the most part). Can be changed by (un)checking `Tools>Options...>General tab>I installed via MSI checkbox` (for Office 2013 in version dropdown). [This checkbox and setting will be removed from the app and combined with the `I installed via Office 365 checkbox` in version 3.2](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/UXL-Launcher/issues/100#issuecomment-395926431). |
| debugmodeShowLabels | False | If this is enabled (`True`), debug labels and other controls will appear on the main window after restarting UXL Launcher. These labels update whenever settings get changed. If the theme engine is enabled, debug labels will show up for the theme engine as well, including buttons that apply the chosen theme (so that you can [preview your custom theme](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/UXL-Launcher/wiki/How-to-Make-a-Custom-Theme-for-UXL-Launcher#previewing-your-custom-theme), if you want to) or the default theme. |
| userChosenTheme | Default | This is the theme that the theme engine uses if it's enabled. This setting first appeared in version 3.1 and can be changed from `Tools>Options...>Personalization tab>Theme list dropdown box`. |
| enableThemeEngine | False | Enables or disables the theme engine. When enabled, it allows you to change the colors of the UXL Launcher main window and Quickmenu (the system tray icon context menu) via predefined or custom themes. This setting first appeared in version 3.1 and can be changed from `Tools>Options...>Personalization tab>Enable UXL Launcher Theme Engine (requires application restart) checkbox`. |
| debugmodeShowThemeEngineOutput | False | If this is enabled (`True`) and the theme engine is enabled, theme engine output such as error messages and other status will be displayed in the Visual Studio Immediate Window and any other configured debug listeners which can make custom theme designing easier. This setting first appeared in version 3.1. |
| hideWhenMinimized | False | When enabled, the main window will be hidden from the taskbar when it's minimized. To bring it back, either double-click the Quickmenu icon in the system tray or right-click the Quickmenu icon and click `Show UXL Launcher`. When the main window is hidden, you can still use the Quickmenu to launch apps, open the Options window, and exit UXL Launcher. This setting first appeared in version 3.1 and can be changed from `View>Hide When Minimized`. |
| userCustomThemePath | (empty) | This is the path to the custom theme the user wants to use, if they want to use a custom theme. This setting first appeared in version 3.1 and can be changed from `Tools>Options...>Personalization tab>Custom theme path textbox`. |
| allowCustomThemes | True | If disabled (`False`), custom themes won't be loaded. This may be helpful for companies and organizations who want to keep their computers locked down. From the changelog: "The user will be told that support for custom themes has been disabled and to contact their administrator if they try to choose a custom theme in the Options window. It may be a good idea to install UXL Launcher and its config file in a location away from regular users with write access, such as in a read-only folder in a network drive and have the config file hidden to prevent modification." This setting first appeared in version 3.1. |
| userUseCustomStatusbarGreeting | False | If enabled, UXL Launcher will display a statusbar greeting personalized with the user's firstname/nickname in the format of `Welcome back to UXL Launcher, Firstname!` The user's firstname/nickname will not be used for personal identification. This setting first appeared in version 3.1 and can be enabled by checking the `Tools>Options...>Personalization tab>Use personalized statusbar greeting radiobutton` or disabled by checking the `Use default statusbar greeting radiobutton`. |
| userFirstNameForCustomStatusbarGreeting | (empty) | This is the user's firstname/nickname that's used in the personalized statusbar greeting, if they want to use one. The user's firstname/nickname will not be used for personal identification. This setting first appeared in version 3.1 and can be changed from `Tools>Options...>Personalization tab>Firstname/nickname textbox`. |
| bypassConfiguredLocationForDeprecatedApps | False | If enabled, certain app buttons will ignore the file path that's used to launch apps and will just run the EXE file for the specified app instead. Such apps include ones that were removed or deprecated from Microsoft Office: Microsoft InfoPath, SharePoint Workspace, Picture Manager, and OneNote for desktop. This setting first appeared in version 3.2 and can be changed from `Tools>Options...>Advanced tab>Bypass configured location for deprecated or removed apps checkbox`. |
| showUnsafeFileExtensionBlockedMessage | True | A messagebox will show up when trying to open files with [potentially unsafe file extensions](../blob/master/UXL-Launcher/Resources/unsafeExtensions_TXT.txt) through the UXL Launcher `File>Open...` dialog saying that the file was blocked from being opened because the extension is potentially unsafe. This setting first appeared in version 3.2. |
