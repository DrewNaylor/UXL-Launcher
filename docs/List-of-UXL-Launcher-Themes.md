This is a list of built-in themes available in UXL Launcher.
The theme list and theme details may vary by version of UXL Launcher and the information provided here is taken from the [most recent official stable release](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/UXL-Launcher/releases/latest).

If custom themes become popular, they can be added to a list of custom themes separate from the table below, perhaps in a table on this page. Likewise, if a custom theme becomes popular with users, it may be added as a built-in theme, with the theme author's permission, of course.

The version of the theme engine each theme file works with is presented in the "Version" column as follows: 
`v1.0 (TE 1.01)`. The first number is the file's version number and the `TE` number that follows it is the version of the theme engine that it works with. Themes missing a number are automatically assumed to be compatible with version 1.01.

In addition to the themes listed here, custom themes are supported. Simply choose the `(Custom)` entry in the `Theme list` dropdown box under `Tools>Options...>Personalization tab`, then either use the `Browse...` button to select a custom theme file or paste the exact file location of the custom theme file into the available textbox, then hit `Save`. There's a wiki page on [how to make your own custom theme](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/UXL-Launcher/wiki/How-to-Make-a-Custom-Theme-for-UXL-Launcher), if you like.
