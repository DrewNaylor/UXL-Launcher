# What is UXL?

UXL (Unified eXecutable Launcher) is the successor to "Drew's App Launcher," and the first stable release will be version 3.0 to show the relationship between Drew's App Launcher (last official release is 2.8.x) and UXL (first official release will be 3.0.)

This software allows the user to launch Microsoft Office apps from one place instead of just using a folder with shortcuts to the apps.

The readme continues after this notice.
