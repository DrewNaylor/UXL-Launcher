# What is UXL?

UXL (Unified eXecutable Launcher) is the successor to "Drew's App Launcher," and the first stable release will be version 3.0 to show the relationship between Drew's App Launcher (last official release is 2.8.x) and UXL (first official release will be 3.0.)


More information to come in the future! In the meantime, please check the repositories of Drew's App Launcher, linked here:
