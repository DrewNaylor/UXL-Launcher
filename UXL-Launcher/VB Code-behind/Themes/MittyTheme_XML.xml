  <Description>Most of the work for version 3.2 was done while my calico cat, Mitty, was still around, so it felt like a good idea to make this theme for her. I miss her.

    <!-- "UseThemeEngineVersion" is used to specify the version of the
  UXL Launcher Theme Engine to use in case there are changes in newer
  versions of the theme engine that designers or developers don't want
  to use. Version 1.01 is the oldest version number available and anything
  smaller than that will automatically be set to 1.01 at runtime. -->
