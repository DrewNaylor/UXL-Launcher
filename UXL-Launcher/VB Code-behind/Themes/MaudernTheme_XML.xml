  <!-- "UseThemeEngineVersion" is used to specify the version of the
  UXL Launcher Theme Engine to use in case there are changes in newer
  versions of the theme engine that designers or developers don't want
  to use. Version 1.01 is the oldest version number available and anything
  smaller than that will automatically be set to 1.01 at runtime. -->

        <!--The MenuBar BackColor variable was previously required because of problems
        with the custom ProfessionalRenderer, but is now set to the same value as
        MenuItem BackColor as the problem seems to be gone if the MenuBar BackColor
        cannot be set when MenuItem also cannot be set, which doesn't make much sense.
        
        Basically, if MenuItem BackColor has an XML element, MenuBar BackColor is set
        to the same thing as MenuItem BackColor, otherwise it's set to the value the
        Default theme uses.-->
