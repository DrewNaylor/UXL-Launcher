        <!--The MenuBar BackColor variable used to be required because of problems
        with the custom ProfessionalRenderer, but is now set to the same value as
        MenuItem BackColor as there seems to not be a problem if the MenuBar BackColor
        cannot be set if MenuItem also cannot be set, which doesn't make much sense.
        
        Basically, if MenuItem BackColor has an XML element, MenuBar BackColor is set
        to the same thing as MenuItem BackColor, otherwise it's set to the value the
        Default theme uses.-->
